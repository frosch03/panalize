* Description

Panalize is a simple script that draws infection data into
diagrams. It uses the data from the CSSE dataset of the Johns Hopkins
University. The dataset is distributed via [[https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19.git][their git repository]].

** IDS
An IDS - Infections Data Set - does contain data about confirmed
infections on a larger scale. This could be the world with details per
contry or a country with details on the regions.

** SIDS
An SIDS - Specific Infections Data Set - does contain data about
confirmed infections limited to a specific set of infections data.
